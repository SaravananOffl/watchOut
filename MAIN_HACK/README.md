# HACKEREARTH-DATA-CHALLENGE---Earthquake-Damage-Prediction-

Earthquake is a good description of a natural phenomenon which suddenly strikes an area causing damage that varies according 
to the intensity of the quake and local geological conditions.When a damaging earthquake hits a populated area, 
it is very important to grasp the overall distribution of building damage within several hours to a few days of the event, 
for the purpose of emergency response and restoration planning. 

An automated model that can predict the extent of damage that is done to a building post earthquake can readily reduce the manpower required in analysing such tasks and lead to quick decision making.
